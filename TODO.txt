Todo
  Deploy to my server  (NOTE: I am using mysql2, not postgresql! I remembered incorrectly.)

Needs Review
  Index page "jumps" when flash is overwritten (e.g. - "Successful login" - now claim a word)
  Add some indication of current status to the edit page
  Export: Get export working

Maybe Later
  Export: How to do filtering? checkbox for each status??
  Dismissable alerts
  (unsure) For admin - make status a dropdown and allow changing/saving??
  automated tests for user/permissions stuff??
  Add events to a history?  "2021/11/30... Edited by John Smith" => https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail
  Q: are you interested in future projects?
     For example: Rails app at https://links.openspace.foundation
       - Needs some tweaks and features
       - Also wondered if we could add Devise and *share* same users as glossary app??

Tests
  usertests.txt - all seem to pass

x Add controller level access restrictions (IE: prevent non-admins from creating words at the controller level)
x Save not working?? (confusion with activerecord #save perhaps??)
x See usertests.txt - added 20 tests, some redundant? - most tests passing
x Should Gemfile.lock be in git?? - keep for now
x Claim a word, then click word - Update doesn't work?
x See file states.txt
x textarea cols: 50 not working
x proper way to add "legend" to right of word notes field?
x Hover over entry for OWNER? (requires some changes)
x A "claimed" entry can be changed only by OWNER or ME
x Only I can: hide, destroy, add new word, mark complete (reviewed)
x Only for me: "hide" and "destroy" icons (instantaneous, returning to index?)
x Completing update should return you to index?
x New _paths
x Word "owner" - display, not for update
x Controller methods??
x notes should also be text/textarea (search for "HF")
x Changed alt to title - OK??
x Seeds? (sqlite db is in git for now)
x Fix "root" (front) page
x Front page doesn't show login...?
x New user signup/login on front page?
x Add field(s) to user profile  (first/last, ...)
x New users?
x Button for: "I claim" this one (must be unclaimed)
x Button for: "Finished, needs review" this one (must be claimed by this user)
x Button for: "Reviewed and OK" (must be ME)
x Button for: "Hide" (must be ME) (no one but me can edit/show)
x How to mark words as unclaimed/hidden/claimed/in-progress/draft/complete?  claimed completed draft hidden in-progress unclaimed
x Dropdown for status?
x Images needed: x/delete, "hide this"
x Set up index?
