Todo
  Non-admin shouldn't be able to edit "word itself" (word.word field)
  Should Gemfile.lock be in git??
  No error msg on bad password
  See usertests.txt - added 20 tests, some redundant? - most tests passing
  Save not working?? (confusion with activerecord #save perhaps??)
  (unsure) Add events to notes field?  "2021/11/30... Edited by John Smith"
  Export feature (see export.rb)
  (not essential) Help me get pg working on Mac?
  Deploy to my server
  (unsure) For admin - make status a dropdown and allow changing/saving??
  Q: are you interested in future projects, and should/can we go outside u p w o r k ?
     For example: Rails app at https://links.openspace.foundation 
       - Needs some tweaks and features
       - Also wondered if we could add Devise and *share* same users as glossary app??

Needs Review
  Add controller level access restrictions (IE: prevent non-admins from creating words at the controller level)

Maybe Later
  automated tests for user/permissions stuff??
